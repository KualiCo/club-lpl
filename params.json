We pick a new programming language every month, then we get together Tuesdays and Thursdays during lunch.\r\n\r\nThe general format of our meeting is:\r\n\r\n### 30min - Instruction\r\n\r\nThis generally involves us watching some tutorial videos, or talks about the language, to grow our knowledge base of it.\r\n\r\n### 30min - Mob Programming\r\n\r\nFor each language we learn, we come up with a simple project that can be accomplished over the month with 1 hour a week. Then we have someone new drive each day and everyone works together on that project. This gets us hands on experience with the language, and hopefully helps to enforce the learnings and paradigms.\r\n",
